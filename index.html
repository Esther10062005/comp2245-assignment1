        <h2>Esther Mckenzie </h2> 
        <p>I am Esther McKenzie, a 19-year-old student at the University of the West Indies, Five Islands Campus, where I study Data Science, Innovation Management, and Computer Science. As a youth parliamentarian, I actively advocate for the needs and concerns of young people in Antigua and Barbuda. I am also a proud team member of Shoreline Sanctuary, a project focused on protecting the coastal environment. My passion lies in driving positive change, whether it's through my work in youth advocacy or environmental conservation. I am committed to making a lasting impact on my community and contributing to a better future for all. I am interested in web developemnt because I am always willing to learn new skills.It is also a means to make additional income.
